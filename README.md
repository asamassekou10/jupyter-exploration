# jupyter-exploration
This repository contains all the work completed for the Jupyter Notebook exploration lab. The goal of this lab was to get hands-on experience with two fundamental tools in data science and software development: GitHub and Jupyter Notebooks.

During the lab, I learned to:

Create and manage a GitHub repository for version control.

Use a Jupyter Notebook to combine code, output, and explanatory text in a single document.

Perform basic operations within a notebook, such as creating markdown and code cells.

Integrate these two tools by uploading a local notebook file to my GitHub repository.

The main file in this repository is Alhassane_Samassekou_L0_ITAI1378.ipynb, which contains a simple "Hello, World!" program and a basic markdown description.
